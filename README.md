The following dataset has been created to expand upon the literature survey presented in the following review article:

Zheng X, Kamat AM, Cao M, Kottapalli AGP. 2021 Creating underwater vision through wavy whiskers: A review of the flow sensing mechanisms and biomimetic potential of seal whiskers. J. Roy. Soc. Interface, in press

The dataset, presented in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, is comprised of three sheets:

1. Whisker behavior in flow (a summary of work, both numerical and experimental, done to study the behavior of seal whiskers or whisker-like structures in flow). This sheet is an expanded version of Table 2 from the above review article.

2. Whisker geometry measurements (a summary of morphometrics conducted on undulating seal whiskers). This sheet is an expanded version of Table 3 from the above review article and will be updated periodically to reflect newer measurements when available in the literature.

3. Whisker material properties (a summary of Young's modulus and density measurements in the literature). This sheet is an expanded version of Table 3 from the above review article and will be updated periodically to reflect newer measurements when available in the literature.

Please let us know if there are any data that could be added to the above dataset.
